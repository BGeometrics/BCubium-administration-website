### <a name="intro"></a>Introduction
At BGeometrics, we want to accomplish this by bringing the BCubium, a full Bitcoin node, and the Lightning Network to the market in a small, craft cube that is just 62mm (2.4 inches) on a side, and sleek. In short, we want to unite Bitcoin’s revolutionary functionality with aesthetics and design.

It is managed by a simple administration website, which in addition to other things will allow you to write a text message on the Bitcoin blockchain that will remain unchanged throughout history. It also includes its own VPN server to connect to your BCubium from your mobile device, preventing third parties from seeing where you are browsing. In short we want to unite Bitcoin functionality with aesthetics and design

BCubium is a very good Bitcoin gift for bitcoiners, for Bitcoin fans, or for anyone who loves wood design or bitcoin ornaments.

BCubium is a full node Bitcoin of BGeometrics [BGeometrics](https://bgeometrics.com/).

Currently the project is in a crowdfunding campaign in Indiegogo <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bcubium-bitcoin-in-wood--2/x/23690676#/">BCubium, "Bitcoin in wood"</a>
